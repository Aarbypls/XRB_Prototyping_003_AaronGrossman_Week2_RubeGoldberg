# Rube Goldberg Prototype

## Concept

This is a Rube Goldberg machine game that allows the player to use and manipulate a selection of pre-made objects in a sandbox environment, altering the world and items around them to their heartâ€™s content.

The objects that the player can manipulate are presented on an inventory screen where the player can choose from items in a variety of different categories, including:

1) Game objects, such as a marble that runs on tracks and through pipes
2) Various sets of dominos, pre-made in different shapes
3) Miscellaneous other items, such as various environmental objects

The player can select the items and then rotate and place them in the world around them. When the marble object passes through the goal object, the game is finished. The player can place multiple different goal objects if they wish, as well as multiple different marbles, dominos, and other objects.

The opportunities are literally endless!
